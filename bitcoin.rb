# Given an array bitcoinPricesYesterday indexed by the number of minutes into the day
# (starting with midnight == 0) and the values are the price of Bitcoin at that time. For example,
# one Bitcoin cost $9000 at 1am, so bitcoinPricesYesterday[60] = 9000. Write an efficient
# algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of a Bitcoin
# yesterday
